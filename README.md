# Ecommerce Sales Analysis
Statistical approach towards online clothes sales analysis

Introduction
At one point in history, a pair of good, clean clothes were considered a necessity, but times have changed.Shopping and especially buying new clothes is a leisure activity for many people. This is the domain we aretackling in this project. We have analyzed the e-commerce sale for July 2020 of summer clothes on the Wish.comwebsite. Wish is an e-commerce company that sells varieties of clothing as well as accessories and is based inthe UK. We will answer a few guiding questions that made us curious at the beginning of the project and willsummarize them using statistics.
Guiding Questions
1. Is a product sold more just because it is priced competitively?
It is not wrong to assume that pricing a product low can lead to good sales. However, since economic conditionsof people improve, priorities that govern a person’s buying choices change. We fi nd out here that is price a factorin the number of units sold for products? We perform proportion test for the same.
2. Does the color of the clothes aff ect the sales?
Choosing a color is a subjective thing for most but certain colors might be preferred by people more than others.Since we are looking at summer data, we will be dividing the colors into “warm” and “cool” categories and fi gureout if selling clothes from a certain category of colors can bring in more sales.
3. What factors aff ect product ratings?
Ratings are an important marker for a customer to see if a product is good or not. Hence, to know from where agood rating count can be achieved is crucial for a company. We compare ratings for products based on theirshipping prices, number of shipping countries, product has been given an ad-boost or not, if it has specialbadges that signify if that product is of good quality, availability of fast shipping or products being made locally.We performed AOVA, linear regression and permutation test to answer this question.
